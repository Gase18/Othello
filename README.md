# Othello

## Introduction

The purpose of this program is to play out like the boardgame othello. 

Ill try using backend to update the position of the markers and what color they are.

Ill use canvas to place my playingarea(gameboard) where i place my markers(black and white).

## Architecture

The "playarea" is placed on a canvas in javascript. I am going to create a grid with 8x8 squares like a othello board. 
Then i am supposed to place markers. Every other marker will be black and white just like in a real board game.

When you place so that there are 1 or more markers with the opposite color between 2 with the same color then the markers in the middle are supposed top change color.
